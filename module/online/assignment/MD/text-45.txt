<p>A shaft running at * rpm is supported by two bearings <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>. The bearings are 2 m apart. Two pulleys of 400 mm and 500 mm diameters are mounted at a distance of 0.4 m (<em>C</em>) and * m (<em>D</em>) from the left bearing respectively. Power of * kW is received by the pulley <em>C</em> is along horizontal whereas power delivered by the pulley <em>D</em> is along 30<sup>0</sup> downward toward belt of pulley <em>C </em>measured from vertical axis. The tension ratio for both the pulleys is two. The design shear stress is * MPa. Design the shaft using maximum shear stress theory using Cm=1.5 and Ct=1.0.</p>
