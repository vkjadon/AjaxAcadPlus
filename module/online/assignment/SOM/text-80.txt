<p>A 3 m long simply supported beam, is supported at points A and B which 2 m apart. Support A is at 0.5 m from one end. The beam is subjected to a linearly varying load with maximum load intensity of * kN/m at point A and zero at B. An anticlockwise moment of * kN.m is applied at free end near to A and a point load of 7.5 kN is applied at other free end in upward direction. Draw Bending Moment diagram.</p>
