<p>Following data are given for a butt joint. <em>t</em>=12 mm.<em> t<sub>o</sub></em>=* mm;&nbsp;<em>t<sub>i</sub></em>=* mm. Recommend the load carrying capacity on the basis of one pitch length for signle row and double rows joints. Also calculate the corresponding efficiencies. Assume pitch as three times rivet diameter. Take &sigma;<sub>dt</sub>=80 MPa; &nbsp;&sigma;<sub>dc</sub>=100 MPa;&nbsp;&tau;<sub>d</sub>= * MPa.</p>
