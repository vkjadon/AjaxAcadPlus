<p>The pitch of outer row of triple riveted double cover plate butt joint is * mm. The plate thickness is&nbsp;* mm. Design the joint for equal and unequal cover plates assuming&nbsp;&sigma;<sub>dt</sub>=100 MPa. The shearing strength can be taken as 0.5 times&nbsp;&sigma;<sub>dt</sub> and crushing strength as 2.5 times the shear strength. You can use <strong><em>t<sub>i</sub></em>=<em>t<sub>o</sub>=</em>0.625<em>t</em></strong> for equal cover plates (<strong>EQP</strong>) and&nbsp; <strong><em>t<sub>i</sub></em>=0.75t ;&nbsp;<em>t<sub>o</sub>=</em>0.625<em>t</em></strong>&nbsp;for unequal cover plates (<strong>UCP</strong>). The pitch of the inner rows (II and III) is half of the outer row (I) in both the cases.</p>
