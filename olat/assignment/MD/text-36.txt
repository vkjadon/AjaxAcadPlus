<p>The column of a drill press is fixed to frame with the help of 8 bolts as shown schemetically in the figure. The load on the radial arm of the drill is inclined at 30 degree as shown. The horizontal and vertical distances from point A to the point of application of load are &nbsp;* mm and * mm respectively. Design the bolt assuming design tensile and shear stresses as 85 MPa and 60 MPa respectively</p>
