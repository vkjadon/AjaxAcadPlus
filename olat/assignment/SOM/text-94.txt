<p>The compression flange a cast iron I-section beam is 120 mm wide and 20 mm deep. The tension flange is 240 mm wide and 40 mm deep. These flanges are connected with * mm deep and * mm wide web. Calculate the intensity of udl applied over a span of 4 m (full beam length) if the maximum permissible stress is 90 MPa in compression and 30 MPa in tension.</p>
