<p>A brass and a steel bars of cross-section size 80 mm x 20 mm are placed together such that steel is at the bottom.&nbsp; The flitched beam so obtained is supported between two ends 2 m apart. Calculate the maximum value of a concentrated load acting at the mid point of the beam such that the maximum stresses in steel and brass are not to exceed * MPa and * MPa respectively . E for steel and brass are 200 GPa and 80 GPa respectively.</p>
