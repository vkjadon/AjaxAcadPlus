<p>Figure shows a composite axial bar made up of steel, bronze and aluminum. Find maximum value of P if the bar is not allowed to deformation beyond * mm. The cross-sectional areas of aluminum is *&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>. The steel bar is twice of the area of aluminum and bronze is thrice. The maximum allowable stresses for steel, bronze and aluminum are 140 MPa, 120 MPa and 80 MPa respectively. <em>E<sub>st</sub> = 200 GPa;&nbsp;</em><em>E<sub>al</sub> = 70 GPa; E<sub>br</sub> = 83 GPa.</em></p>
